# Open Source Contribution Session

### Bio Upload Instructions

Normal GitHub workflow for contributing to a project:

1. Fork repository at the top right
2. Go to your fork
3. Add `yourname.md` file with bio of yourself in the `Participants` folder. (for example `participants/yourname.md`, **note: name in lowercase**)
4. Make a PR for your changes
5. Then... *Relax*!
